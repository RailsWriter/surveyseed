---You ask all kinds of personal information & then turn around & say your information doesn't qualify? Kind of fraudulent don't you think? --

It is understandable that you had the frustration that you expressed. We are sorry to hear that. Hopefully the following explanation will at the least help understand why this happens. 

The survey makers restrict qualification to certain profiles - very specific in terms of personal information. There is unfortunately no way to be able to determine if one would qualify for a survey until we ask the profile information. Once we get that information only then our algorithms can determine if there are matching survey(s) that one qualifies for. In some cases, at some times it does happen that there is no existing survey that one qualifies for.

While this may not be the best resolution for you, if you join Ketsci Panel the profile information you have already entered will be re-used to check if there is a qualified survey and you would not have to re-enter that information to attempt new surveys. Ketsci will be sending you email notifications when new surveys will be available.

Please let me know if you would like to do this. I would add you to our Panel and send you an invitation to complete surveys when new surveys arrive. Thanks again for using Ketsci.
